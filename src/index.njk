<section id="overview">
  <h2>Awesome Static Tools</h2>
  <p class="prose">
    This project is a curated set of <strong>tiny, copy‑paste enhancements</strong> for static sites and 11ty. It exists to help you add
    useful interactions (search, tooltips, scroll effects, galleries, etc.) without heavy frameworks, build steps, or bloat—staying true
    to the <strong>JAMstack</strong> values of performance, accessibility, and simplicity.
  </p>
  <p class="prose">
    On this page you’ll see <strong>inline demos</strong> of each tool, organized as small, reusable <strong>partials</strong>. Every demo shows the
    minimal markup and initialization you need. You can:
  </p>
  <ul class="prose">
    <li>Skim the examples and copy what you need.</li>
    <li>Explore categories like media, search, interactivity, typography, and sharing.</li>
    <li>Read deeper in the docs linked from the repository for options and accessibility notes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">Tip: Use these as starting points—compose a few to create rich pages while keeping bundle size low.</p>

  Tufte CSS is shown on a <a href="/tufte/">separate page</a> due to custom fonts.
